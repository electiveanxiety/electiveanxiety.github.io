      <description>&#39;Let me run ahead,&amp;rsquo; said Charlotte, &amp;lsquo;and see if I can guess what you are aiming at. Just as everything has an attraction to itself, so too there must be a relationship with other things.&amp;lsquo;
&amp;ndash;Goethe, Elective Affinities
 &amp;lsquo;Elective affinity,&amp;rsquo; a concept in part popularized by Goethe&amp;rsquo;s 1809 classic novel, attempts to describe a sociological and political economic imperative. In his seminal work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Max Weber appropriates the term to outline a kind of structural causality&amp;ndash;the way that the &amp;lsquo;spirit&amp;rsquo; of a political economy shapes and in turn is shaped by the cohesion and adherence of its relationship to its form.</description>
