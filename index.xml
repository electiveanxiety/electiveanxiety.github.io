      <description>Introduction Pending; requires a completed essay and thesis.
Platform Capitalism, the Time/Space Crunch, and a New Economy In recent years, there has been a serious effort by some on the left to develop a political economic critique of capitalism that is attentive to, what seems to be, a fundamental restructuring of the relationship between labor, capital, and technology.

      <description>&#39;Let me run ahead,&amp;rsquo; said Charlotte, &amp;lsquo;and see if I can guess what you are aiming at. Just as everything has an attraction to itself, so too there must be a relationship with other things.&amp;lsquo;
&amp;ndash;Goethe, Elective Affinities
 &amp;lsquo;Elective affinity,&amp;rsquo; a concept in part popularized by Goethe&amp;rsquo;s 1809 classic novel, attempts to describe a sociological and political economic imperative. In his seminal work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Max Weber appropriates the term to outline a kind of reciprocal causality&amp;ndash;the way that the &amp;lsquo;spirit&amp;rsquo; of a political economy shapes and is in turn shaped by the cohesion and adherence of its relationship to its form.</description>
