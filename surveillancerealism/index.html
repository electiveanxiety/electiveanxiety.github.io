<h3 id="platform-capitalism-the-timespace-crunch-and-a-new-economy">Platform Capitalism, the Time/Space Crunch, and a New Economy</h3>
<p>In recent years, there has been a serious effort by some on the left to develop a political economic critique of capitalism that is attentive to, what seems to be, a fundamental restructuring of the relationship between labor, capital, and technology. There is no sense in reanalyzing or redefining concepts already sufficiently outlined by political economists.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said that this new development has unbounded possibilities for good and for evil. For one thing, it makes the metaphorical dominance of the machines, as imagined by Samuel Butler, a most immediate and non-metaphorical problem. It gives the human race a new and most effective collection of mechanical slaves to perform its labor. Such mechanical labor has most of the economic properties of slave labor, although, unlike slave labor, it does not involve the direct demoralizing effects of human cruelty. However, any labor that accepts the conditions of competition with slave labor accepts the conditions of slave labor, and is essentially slave labor. The key word of this statement is competition. It may very well be a good thing for humanity to have the machine remove from it the need of menial and disagreeable tasks, or it may not. I do not know. It cannot be good for these new potentialities to be assessed in the terms of the market, of the money they save; and it is precisely the terms of the open market, the “fifth freedom,” that have become the shibboleth of the sector of American opinion represented by the National Association of Manufacturers and the Saturday Evening Post. I say American opinion, for as an American, I know it best, but the hucksters recognize no national boundary.&rdquo; &ndash;Norbert Weiner</p>
<p>The political economic conditions of the contemporary digital landscape (i.e. a data economy premised almost completely on extraction and an industrial model based on ownership of server and network infrastructure), like the technical landscape of the industrial, post-war U.S. in 1947, when Weiner was writing, details a new set of relations for all participants in the market, and thusly, most of the participants being workers, a new set of economic conditions for labor. Neil Postman&rsquo;s concept, Technopoly, best describes this new relation. The worker, operating in an economy that accepts the conditions of slave labor, was first faced with competing with a generalized automation. Soon, though, automation subsumed the laborer in digital age. Particularly, the advent of networks, reshaped the worker&rsquo;s relationship to technology altogether. With the space/time crunch of the 1970s and the off shoring of a significant portion of industrial production from the United States, the new technological infrastructure took on the same form as the automation in the factory. Service workers soon found themselves facing the same competition with slave labor that industrial workers found themselves in the 20th century. However, in addition, both the consumer and employee were subject to the new economics of data extraction. The persona, turned into a commodity, developed conditions of subservience and reliance on techniques of data extraction never seen before in humanity. While human demographics were always commodified, the specificity and intensity of data capture made possible through online shopping, social media websites, or simply web browsing opened up this new kind of relationship: a relationship of subservience to machines. The cultural landscape, defined by observation, is a result of the advance of automation and the adaptation of the conditions of slave labor outside of the factory and into the public cultural sphere.</p>
<p>Weiner also says plainly:
&ldquo;The [automatic machine] is not frightening because of any danger that it may achieve autonomous control over humanity&hellip; Its real danger&hellip; is the quite different one that such machines, though helpless by themselves, may be used by a human being or a block of human beings to increase their control over the rest of the human race&hellip; by means not of machines themselves but through&hellip; techniques as narrow and indifferent to human possibility as if they had, in fact, been conceived mechanically&hellip; In order to avoid the manifold dangers of this, both external and internal&hellip; we must know&hellip; what man&rsquo;s nature is and what his built-in purposes are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The argument has been made before: the public produces data that then produces profit, but sees no compensation. In fact, some argue that the value of data is, in fact, worthless to the individual. They&rsquo;d be somewhat right, one person selling their personal information in the market is, effectively worthless, but the serious and carefully networked harvesting of data from even the most basic interactions and online behaviors is not. The product of this extraction, is of course, largely targeted advertising. It is also the temporal dislocation of the person through new technologies of perception, and, thus, the necessary conditions for unimaginable surveillance projects.</p>
